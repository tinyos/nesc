This is the 1.1 (alpha test) release of nesC. 

Installation instructions are in INSTALL, and are essentially unchanged
since 1.0. Note that this release of nesC includes a patched GNU assembler
for the AVR (to support debugging).  An appopriate version of the assembler
is installed in ncc's support directory (usually /usr/local/lib/ncc) based
on your installed version of avr-gcc (2.11.2 for avr-gcc up to 3.1.1, 
2.13.2.1 for later avr-gcc's).

The following is a summary of the changes in nesC 1.1:
- Support for new language features:
  o atomic sections
  o compile-time data race detection
  o explicit marking of asynchronous (aka interrupt) code (async keyword on
    commands and events)
  o automatic combining of results of multiply-wired functions
  These are enabled with the new -Wnesc-all option. These changes will be
  fully described in an updated nesC reference manual.

- new nesC warning flags/changes:
  o -W[no-]unexpected-docstring is now -Wnesc-docstring, and defaults to off
  o -W[no-]nesc-fnptr: warn for uses of function pointers
  o -W[no-]nesc-data-race: turn on[off] compile-time data race detection
  o -W[no-]nesc-async: warn [bug in alpha: error] if asynchronous code calls
    synchronous code
  o -W[no-]nesc-combine: warn when multiply wired functions do not have
    a combining function defined on the result type. See tos.h for the
    the combining function definition for result_t
  o -Wnesc-all: same as -Wnesc-data-race -Wnesc-async -Wnesc-fnptr and
                -Wnesc-combine

- The NESC preprocessor symbol is defined to XYZ, where X is the major
  version, Y the minor and Z the patchlevel. So nesc 1.1 defines NESC as 110

- Tool chain changes:
  o ncc has been split into two files: ncc and nescc
    TinyOS-specific code is in ncc, nescc is a "generic" nesC compiler
    (nescc does not automatically include tos.h, and does not automatically
     add the TinyOS directory structure to the search path)
  o the -fnesc-include=<filename> option includes a C file before compiling
    the requested component (used by ncc to include tos.h...)
    You can specify several -fnesc-include=... options
  o A hardware platform X can now more easily added:
    - create directory .../tos/platforms/X
    - place a .platform file in .../tos/platforms/X. Look at existing
      .platform files for inspiration.
  o A sensor board Y can add directories to the search path if there is
    a .sensor file in the .../tos/sensorboards/Y directory
    (as with .platform, .sensor is just perl code so can modify the
    variables used by ncc to achieve whatever effect is necessary)
  o set-mode-id works for programs greater than 64K

- New tool to extract (enum) constants from C code: ncg. Usage is similar
  to mig.
- Debugging on mica supports with the Atmel JTAG ICE and the AvarICE
  project (at http://sourceforge.net/projects/avarice)

- Some improved error messages, miscellaneous bug fixes



Scheduled changes before the final release:
- documentation updates for new tools and features
- gdb patches to fix a number of debugging problems with nesC
- support initialisers on module variables
- 8051 platform support (with Keil C) from David Patnode
- a few bugs that need tracking down
- clean up combining function association with types
