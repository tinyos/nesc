/* Declaration of __nesc_enable_interrupt function. Data-race detection
   and duplicate atomic suppression needs to be aware of these calls to
   function correctly.

   The current implementation is simplistic (conservative and unsafe):
   If function X calls __nesc_enable_interrupt, we assume that:
   - there are non-atomic calls to X
   - calls made from inside an atomic statement in X are still atomic
     (i.e., we assume there is no way to reach a statement inside 'atomic'
     from the __nesc_enable_interrupt() call. We do issue a warning when
     __nesc_enable_interrupt() is called from within an atomic statement).

   The proper behaviour would be to analyse X's control flow graph.
