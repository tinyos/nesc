/* A generic, OO-ish AST walker.
   This is probably a visitor, for those into that kind of thing. 
   The walker functions receive a node * rather than a node, 
   so can modify the tree during the walk. This allows, e.g., 
   cloning the AST.

   Note: the aw_walk and aw_call_parent results will be applied to
   *n after the walker function returns, not to the orignal node.
