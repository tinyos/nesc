/* A generic directed graph type, with support for typical graph algos.
*/

/* A graph is a mutable data structure composed of nodes linked 
   by edges.

   Edges can be added and removed between existing nodes, nodes can
   be added at will but only removed if they have no ingoing and no
   outgoing edges.

   Each edge & node has associated user data (stored as a (void *))
   and a mark. Marks can be cleared individually or over the
   whole graph (this last op remains O(1)).

   The order of edges within a node is not preserved.
