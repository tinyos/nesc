/* Effects: We want to check whether e is a constant, and possibly for
     valid constant values, exactly once (to avoid repeated errors and
     warnings) over our multiple constant folding passes. Additionally,
     we can't check unknown constants until their value is known. We can
     rely on the following:
     - a non-constant will not become constant
     - we assume, for checking purposes, that a constant's kind (numerical
       vs address) will not change (this in some sense untrue, as in:
         <unknown> ? <numerical> : <address>
       but we treat that as <address> for checking purposes)
     - a known constant will maintain its value
     - an unknown constant will become either non-constant or a known constant

     Additionally, if the constant kind does not match k, we can check it
     immediately (presumably to report some error).
     
     check_constant_once supports this by returning TRUE exactly once, when
     its possible to check e's value

   Returns: TRUE the first time !e->cst || e->cst && !constant_unkown(e) ||
     e->cst && e->cst does not match k
